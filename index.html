                    Presidium believes that academic learning and sports complement each other. The institution follows a comprehensive educational approach that includes sports as an important pillar of education. Sports are an important contributor in developing the overall personality of students. Other than sportsmanship, it promotes the qualities of leadership, sharing, team spirit and tolerance in students. It teaches the value of time and how it is important to note how a single minute can decide the fate of a young sportsmen in the field of competition. At Presidium, we believe in fostering sportsmanship and athletic excellence in our students and thus, several sports competitions are organized every year.

                    “Libraries allow children to ask questions about the world and find the answers. And the wonderful thing is that once a child learns to use a library, the doors to learning are always open.”
                    A treasure trove and storehouse of knowledge, a library is a place to learn, think and share ideas.

                    Presidium has provided students with a library architecture that is inspirational and conducive to learning, improved communication and interaction.

                    To fire Presidians’ imagination and keeping the access easy, computers have been incorporated in the library so that a world of knowledge is readily available to students.

                    Dull classrooms with just furniture and a blackboard is not what you will see in Presidium classes. The classrooms are designed in a way that fosters excellence and motivates students towards better performance. Each classroom is aesthetically designed and integrated with smart boards to make both the learning and teaching interactive. With technological support, our skilled teachers provide guidance to each individual.
