                    Presidium believes that academic learning and sports complement each other. The institution follows a comprehensive educational approach that includes sports as an important pillar of education. Sports are an important contributor in developing the overall personality of students. Other than sportsmanship, it promotes the qualities of leadership, sharing, team spirit and tolerance in students. It teaches the value of time and how it is important to note how a single minute can decide the fate of a young sportsmen in the field of competition. At Presidium, we believe in fostering sportsmanship and athletic excellence in our students and thus, several sports competitions are organized every year.

                    A treasure trove and storehouse of knowledge, a library is a place to learn, think and share ideas.

                    Presidium has provided students with a library architecture that is inspirational and conducive to learning, improved communication and interaction.

                    To fire Presidians’ imagination and keeping the access easy, computers have been incorporated in the library so that a world of knowledge is readily available to students.

                The belief that Nobel laureates are not created in huge research facilities, but in the humble school labs, lead to the creation of hi-tech science labs at Presidium. Science is different from any other subject. In order to understand its concepts, one has to look beyond the books and conventional classroom teaching, this is where the labs come-in. It is imperative for the school to get all updated equipments so that students get to explore experiment and form their own conclusions and that what Presidium aims at.
